MOON SONGS

My project serves as a music album promotion tool. It features the music of Pop/Jazz artist, Rachel Ohnsman, whose songs correspond with the each phase of the moon. My design creates a listening journey; the cycle format allows users to begin with any moon phase.

My design allows for a learning experience as well. When users click on the moon to listen to the music, the name of that moon phase appears.

The play/stop buttons allow the user to play multiple songs at once. I call this the "DJ" feature, for users can play around with which songs sound cool together.

My target audience is young adults who are fascinated by the moon cycle, as well as young adults who are interested in Rachel's music.

The project will be displayed on computers and mobile devices. It will be presented on various social media platforms throughout the promotion of the album.
